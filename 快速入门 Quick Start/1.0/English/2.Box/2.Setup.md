I believe that you have found in the previous practice of adding, deleting and changing code, addObject, setObject, getObject as long as their purpose can not be achieved, then they will report an error to force the termination of the program.

That's why it says in the previous blurb that it has more secure data management capabilities.

Of course this behavior of reporting an error if you don't achieve your goal is certainly safe, but there are some scenarios where you can't terminate the program, such as a multi-threaded environment.

Then you can turn off strict mode by using the strictModel method, i.e., instead of throwing an exception, you can return the corresponding value, such as fasle or null, if you fail to achieve your goal, as shown in the following code example:
```java
	//false turns off strict mode and the program will no longer throw exceptions
        //true turns on strict mode and throws an exception if the destination is not reached.
        box.strictModel(false);
```
The operation is very simple and its scope is judged by the location of your code, an example is given below:
```java
	//Since the name of the data entered here is b1, 
	//and not a1 as stored earlier, an exception is thrown here, terminating the program
        System.out.println(box.getObject("b1",Integer.class));
        
        //Strict mode is turned off here, but since the code comes after the exception-throwing scenario,
	// it doesn't actually run with strict mode turned off
        box.strictModel(false);
```
But if you switch the following order for example:
```java
	box.addObject("a1",10);
        box.strictModel(false);

        //Since strict mode is turned off, this outputs null
        System.out.println(box.getObject("b1",Integer.class));
```
Strict mode is on by default.



When you knocked out the code earlier, you should have noticed that box has a method that is putObject, which is exactly the same as the SimpleBox method of the same name earlier, but using that method in box will directly throw an exception. Because the introduction mentions that the implementation class is the operation logic of the collection, so naturally it is not allowed to use putObject this add and modify as one of the methods.

But if you don't like the operation logic of the collection, then you can turn off the collection mode through the method setMode, which allows the use of the putObject method, and changes to the addObject and setObject methods, the operation is the same as strictModel, the following is the code example:
```java
 	//Allowing this method on its own, without context, is a sure way to throw an exception
        box.setObject("a1",10);
```
But you precede this code with the setMode method:
```java
	//Turn off collection mode
        box.setMode(false);

        //Since the collection mode is turned off, it no longer throws exceptions,
	//but instead adds the data
        box.setObject("a1",10);
```
The addObject and setObject methods in box are based on putObject to do some judgment conditions to encapsulate, so even if you turn off the collection mode, you can use the same addObject and setObject methods, but the essence is to use the putObject method, of course, you can also directly use the putObject method, it depends on your preference, collection mode is on by default.
