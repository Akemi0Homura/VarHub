box's conditional judgment can make the data management security, but it has a big problem, that is, in the high concurrency under a certain danger, 
especially in the additions, deletions and changes in the centralized processing together.

This is because a large number of threads into the box internal conditional judgment, will compete with each other, and I for better high concurrency performance,
did not go to do synchronized processing, because in the ConcurrentHashMap on the internal multi-threaded security measures, if I am outside in the do it will be a little redundant,
appeared to be a thread-safety problem is usually a way to solve.

If you are experiencing problems with multi-threaded environments, then follow the below method to try to solve it accordingly:
1. Turn off strict mode
2. Use synchronized
3. Close the collection mode
4. Use SimpleBox

If it appears that you have to execute method #4 to solve the problem, or none of the above methods can solve the problem, 
then please check your own code, because this is usually not a VarHub problem. For example, switch to the official java ConcurrentHashMap to operate.

If you can determine that it's a VarHub issue, then please go to github and give the code that reproduces the bug.
