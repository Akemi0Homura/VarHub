This is a code example of a method to add data:
```java
	//Create a Box object
        StockpilePlus box= Box.getBox();
        //Add data to the Box object
        box.addObject("a1",10);
```
This is the sample code of the method to get the data combined with the above code:
```java
	//Creates a box object in another class.
    	StockpilePlus box= Box.getBox();
	//Prints the variable a1, where a run will print the previously deposited integer type 10
        System.out.println(box.getObject("a1",Integer.class));
```
Since the methods for adding and getting Object and SimpleBox passing parameters are the same, they are not demonstrated here.
Next demonstrates the method of modifying the code example in conjunction with the above code:
```java
	//Modify the value of a1 to integer 20
        box.setObject("a1",20);
```
This modifies it, and the next to last method is to delete the data:
```java
	//Deletes the integer data name a1.
        box.removeObject("a1",Integer.class);
```
This way a1 can be deleted successfully.
