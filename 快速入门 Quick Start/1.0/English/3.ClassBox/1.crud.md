The ClassBox additions, deletions, and modifications are almost identical to the previous Boxes at the API level, so this is just a quick take-away:
```java
	//Creating ClassBox Objects
        Repository box= ClassBox.getClassBox();

        //Add the integer 10, the third parameter can actually be any class
        //But it's better to write the class that currently stores this data, so it's easier to remember and logical.
        //The fourth parameter is the strict mode switch, 
	//true is on, false is off, the specific logic is basically the same as the Box
        box.addObject("a1",10,Boxtest.class,true);

	//Creating ClassBox Objects
    	Repository box= ClassBox.getClassBox();

	//Here the a1 data from the Integer of the Boxtest class is printed and the run results in 10.
	//The last parameter is the strict mode switch
        System.out.println(box.getObject("a1",Integer.class,Boxtest.class,true));
```
And finally, a demonstration of modifying data and deleting data:
```java
	//Modify the data, the source of which is the a1 data in the Integer of the Boxtest class, to 30
        box.setObject("a1",30,Boxtest.class,true);

	//Delete the data, the source of the deleted data is the a1 data in the Integer of the Boxtest class
        box.removeObject("a1",Integer.class,Boxtest.class);
```
The operation of the object is basically the same as SimpleBox, and will not be demonstrated here.
