If the amount of data you want to store is very large, or even if you want to leave all the variables to VarHub, then I recommend using this ClassBox implementation class.

As the name suggests, it can be implemented under different class names, different data types, duplicate data names, so it can store huge amounts of data and it has more granular and strict schema settings compared to Box.
