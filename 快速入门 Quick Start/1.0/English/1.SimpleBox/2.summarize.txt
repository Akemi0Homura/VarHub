Simplebox is based on ConcurrentHashMap table for simple encapsulation.
Simple to operate , and high concurrency performance , multi-threaded security , do not have to worry about hash conflicts .
However, since adding data and modifying data share a common method, it is less secure for variable management.
So if the amount of data is not too large, it is recommended to use this implementation class, but if it is related to web development, I do not really recommend it.
