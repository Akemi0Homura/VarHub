This is a code to add data and get data, here is an example of a wrapper class and an object class:

```java
public class SimpleBoxtest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Creates the SimpleBox box object.
        Stockpile box= SimpleBox.getSimpleBox();

        //Then call the method to add the data, 
	//the first for the name of the data, the second for you data
        box.putObject("a1",10);

        test temp=new test();
        temp.test1();
    }
}

class test {
       Stockpile box= SimpleBox.getSimpleBox();

    void test1(){
	//Use the getObject method to get the object, 
	//the first is the data name and the second is the data type. 
	//The printout will be integer 10
	System.out.println(box.getObject("a1",Integer.class));
    }
}
```
and
```java
public class SimpleBoxtest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stockpile box= SimpleBox.getSimpleBox();

        //This is a customized object
        app1 a1= new app1();
        
        //stored object
        box.putObject("a1",a1);

        test temp=new test();
        temp.test1();
    }
}

class test {
    Stockpile box= SimpleBox.getSimpleBox();

    void test1(){
        //Since getObject returns object, it needs to be strongly converted
        app1 a1= (app1) box.getObject("a1",app1.class);

	//Running here prints the memory address of the object
        System.out.println(a1);
    }
}
```
The above is an example of adding add data and adding objects and getting data and objects.

The API method for changing data is the same as adding data, because this implementation class is encapsulated based on hash table operations, so it will not be demonstrated here.

Here is a simple demonstration of the removeObject method for deleting data:

Packaging category: box.removeObject("a1",a1);

Object Classes: box.removeObject("a1",a1);

If you can't read it, think about it in conjunction with the code above.

If you've read this, then congratulations, you've successfully mastered SimpleBox!
